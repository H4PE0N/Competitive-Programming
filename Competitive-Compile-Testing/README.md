To compile the program, make sure you have the GCC compiler  
downloaded, and execute the following command in  the  same  
folder as the program.

```
gcc -o competitive-compile-testing competitive-compile-testing.c \
../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-1/competitive-functions-program-1.c \
../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-2/competitive-functions-program-2.c \
../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-3/competitive-functions-program-3.c \
../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-4/competitive-functions-program-4.c \
../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-5/competitive-functions-program-5.c \
../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-6/competitive-functions-program-6.c \
../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-7/competitive-functions-program-7.c \
../Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-1/competitive-functions-testing-1.c \
../Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-2/competitive-functions-testing-2.c \
../Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-3/competitive-functions-testing-3.c \
../Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-4/competitive-functions-testing-4.c \
../Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-5/competitive-functions-testing-5.c \
../Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-6/competitive-functions-testing-6.c \
../Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-7/competitive-functions-testing-7.c -lm
```

After you have compiled the  program,  type  the  following  
command to run the executable file, that is going to appear  
in the folder:

```
./competitive-compile-testing
```
