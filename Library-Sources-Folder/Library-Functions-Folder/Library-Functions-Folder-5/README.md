The functions in this folder are all based on the same area
in programming. In this folder you will find functions that
are based on binary strings. Binary strings  is  a  way  of
writing data with only two characters (integers), a one and
a zero. These functions  let  you  convert  from  decimal /
character to binary and contrariwise

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

binary_integer_enough         nearest_binary_length

reduce_binary_integer         convert_integer_binary

allocate_binary_bit           convert_character_binary

allocate_binary_bits          increase_binary_integer

actual_binary_length          convert_binary_integer

convert_binary_character      calculate_bit_integer

generate_random_binary        binary_range_between

convert_string_binary         convert_binary_string

convert_binary_array          convert_array_binary
