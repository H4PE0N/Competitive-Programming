In this folder you will find the programs and functions
that builds up this library. All the functions you  can
think of will probably be in one of these  folders.  If
you think one of the  functions  function  incorrectly,
you can test it in the Functions-Testing-Folder.

To make all the programs have the access they  need  to
the functions they use, a header  file  is  located  in
this folder. All the programs in this  folder,  in  the
Functions-Testing-Folder       and        in        the
Create-Programs-Folder is using the header  file.  That
makes it really easy to include all  the  functions  in
this library.

In the header file in  this  folder  there  is  include
statements for all the standard C  libraries  that  the
functions in this library is  using.  So  by  including
this header  file,  the  programs  is  including  those
libraries as well.

This is somewhat what these folders contains, what kind
of functions there is in them:

Library-Functions-Folder-1 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around integer arrays. They are
build up by integers.

Library-Functions-Folder-2 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around integer  matrices.  They
are build up by integer arrays.

Library-Functions-Folder-3 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around integer  hash-maps.  The
hash-maps are made from matrices with only two columns.
Both the keyword and value are integers, so  it's  kind
of like a frequency board.

Library-Functions-Folder-4 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around character strings.  They
are made by characters.

Library-Functions-Folder-5 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around binary data-types.  Here
you can find conversions from and to binary.

Library-Functions-Folder-6 - This    folder    contains
functions  that  are   made   around   statistics   and
probability. Here you can find the odds  and  risks  to
something and useful data from arrays and  other  sets.

Library-Functions-Folder-7 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around binary operations. These
are low level operations with binary  data-types.  Here
you can find functions like or, and, xor and not.

Library-Functions-Folder-8 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around integers. So  everything
from math to random generations and things  like  that.
This is the most fundamental data-type in this library.

Library-Functions-Folder-9 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around string  sentences.  They
are made from two dimensional character arrays. So it's
like a matrix but with characters instead of integers.

Library-Functions-Folder-10 - This   folder    contains
functions that are made around time operations. If  you
want a delay or a timer in your program, here  can  you
find the functions you need. The only thing that  isn't
so great, is that they only count  in  seconds,  so  no
milliseconds.
