This folder contains folders that have written code  in
them. All  the  functions  and  testing  functions  are
located here in this folder. Everything you will  write
is going to be in  one  of  these  folders.  The  first
folder contains the programs that you as a user of this
library, will write code in. The second folder contains
programs that test the third folders functions. If  you
think one of the functions you're using is a little bit
wrong, you can test it in the second folder. The  third
folder contains library functions,  the  functions  you
bought the library for.

This is what the folders in this  folder  contains.  If
you  are  wondering  exactly  what  they   contain,   I
recommend you open one of them and see for your self:

Create-Programs-Folder - Here you can  write  the  code
you want for your program. All the  functions  in  this
library is linked to the master program. But  only  the
functions-bootup-programs has  access  to  the  testing
functions.

Functions-Testing-Folder - Here is the  test  functions
for the third folders functions located. Every function
except for  the  random  and  output  functions  has  a
test-function in this folder.

Library-Functions-Folder - Here is the  functions  that
builds up this  whole  library.  There  are  a  lot  of
functions you can choose from, so look around  and  see
which one you want to have in your program.
