This folder contains the test  functions  and  programs
for the Library-Functions-Folder  functions.  The  only
functions that isn't in here  are  the  functions  that
generates a random value. Or the functions  that  makes
an output on your screen.

In this folder there is a header file, just like in the
Library-Functions-Folder, but that includes the  header
files from this folder. That make it  easy  to  include
the    functions    from    this    folder    to    the
functions-bootup-programs.

So all of the folders that is in this  folder  contains
the    same    kind    of    functions     that     the
Library-Functions-Folder. So it would be  dumb  to  say
what the folders contains again.

This is somewhat what these folders contains, what kind
of functions there is in them:

Library-Functions-Folder-1 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around integer arrays. They are
build up by integers.

Library-Functions-Folder-2 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around integer  matrices.  They
are build up by integer arrays.

Library-Functions-Folder-3 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around integer  hash-maps.  The
hash-maps are made from matrices with only two columns.
Both the keyword and value are integers, so  it's  kind
of like a frequency board.

Library-Functions-Folder-4 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around character strings.  They
are made by characters.

Library-Functions-Folder-5 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around binary data-types.  Here
you can find conversions from and to binary.

Library-Functions-Folder-6 - This    folder    contains
functions  that  are   made   around   statistics   and
probability. Here you can find the odds  and  risks  to
something and useful data from arrays and  other  sets.

Library-Functions-Folder-7 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around binary operations. These
are low level operations with binary  data-types.  Here
you can find functions like or, and, xor and not.

Library-Functions-Folder-8 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around integers. So  everything
from math to random generations and things  like  that.
This is the most fundamental data-type in this library.

Library-Functions-Folder-9 - This    folder    contains
functions that are made around string  sentences.  They
are made from two dimensional character arrays. So it's
like a matrix but with characters instead of integers.

Library-Functions-Folder-10 - This   folder    contains
functions that are made around time operations. If  you
want a delay or a timer in your program, here  can  you
find the functions you need. The only thing that  isn't
so great, is that they only count  in  seconds,  so  no
milliseconds.
