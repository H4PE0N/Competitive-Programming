<pre>
This folder contains programs that you as a user  would
write your code in. Every function in this  library  is
linked to these programs. So you can use  every  single
one of them if you wanted to.

The  master  program  does  not  have  access  to   the
test-functions, that is because they are made to  debug
and test the original functions. This may change in the
future, but for now the test-functions only is for  the
functions-booup-programs.

In the Functions-Bootup-Folder are  they  programs  for
every programming area. That means  that  every  folder
with a specific area has a  different  bootup  program.
That is because you could  write  your  tests  for  the
functions in one area,  and  then  tests  for  another,
without having to run both at once.
