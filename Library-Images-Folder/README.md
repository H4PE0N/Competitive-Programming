This folder contains images of some  logotypes.  It  is
just a way of saying that you have  bought  my  project
and you can use the images for something you want.  The
only thing you cant do is pretend  you  have  done  the
library and  the  content  it  contains.  You  can  use
whatever you want in this library, but remember to  say
where you got it from. That means you will have to link
this library on GitHub from your code. Only if you make
it public, if you use these functions for yourself  you 
don't have to say where you got them from.
