To compile the program, make sure you have the GCC compiler  
downloaded, and execute the following command in  the  same  
folder as the program.

gcc -o competitive-testing-bootup-6 competitive-testing-bootup-6.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-1/competitive-functions-program-1-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-1/competitive-functions-program-1-2.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-2/competitive-functions-program-2-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-2/competitive-functions-program-2-2.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-3/competitive-functions-program-3-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-3/competitive-functions-program-3-2.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-4/competitive-functions-program-4-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-4/competitive-functions-program-4-2.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-5/competitive-functions-program-5-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-5/competitive-functions-program-5-2.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-6/competitive-functions-program-6-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-6/competitive-functions-program-6-2.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-7/competitive-functions-program-7-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-7/competitive-functions-program-7-2.c \
../../Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-6/competitive-functions-testing-6-1.c -lm

After you have compiled the  program,  type  the  following  
command to run the executable file, that is going to appear  
in the folder:

./competitive-testing-bootup-6
