To compile the program, make sure you have the GCC compiler  
downloaded, and execute the following command in  the  same  
folder as the program.

gcc -o testing-bootup-program-1 testing-bootup-program-1.c \
../../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-1/library-functions-program-1-1.c \
../../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-1/library-functions-program-1-2.c \
../../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-1/library-functions-program-1-3.c \
../../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-2/library-functions-program-2-1.c \
../../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-2/library-functions-program-2-2.c \
../../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-2/library-functions-program-2-3.c \

After you have compiled the  program,  type  the  following  
command to run the executable file, that is going to appear  
in the folder:

./testing-bootup-program-1
