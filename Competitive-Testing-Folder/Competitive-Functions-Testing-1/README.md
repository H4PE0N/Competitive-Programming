These  functions  are  created  from  the  original  library  
functions. You can visit the  original  functions  here,  if  
you are on the master branch: [Competitive-Function-Folder-1](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-1)

If you are on the development  branch,  you  can  visit  the  
original functions here: [Competitive-Function-Folder-1](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/development/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-1)

Here is the functions that  tests  the  original  functions:

```
allocate_array_integer_test      sort_integer_iteration_test

allocate_array_integers_test     sort_integer_array_test

generate_integer_array_test      add_array_integer_test

integer_array_length_test        move_array_integers_test

array_contains_integer_test      remove_array_integer_test

switch_array_integers_test       delete_array_integer_test

compare_integer_arrays_test      remove_array_integers_test
