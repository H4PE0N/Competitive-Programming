This folder  contains  functions  that  tests  the  library  
functions. Every library function  have  it's corresponding  
test function, with an added `_test` to the function  name.

The folders contains the same  kind  of  functions  as  the  
function library folders. That means the  first  folder  in  
this folder contains test functions of array-functions.
