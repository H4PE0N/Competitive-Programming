These  functions  are  created  from  de  original  library  
functions. You  can  visit  the  original  functions  here:  
[Competitive-Function-Folder-3](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-3)

To compile the program, make sure you have the GCC compiler  
downloaded, and execute the following command in  the  same  
folder as the program.

```
gcc -o competitive-testing-bootup-3 competitive-testing-bootup-3.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-1/competitive-functions-program-1-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-1/competitive-functions-program-1-2.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-2/competitive-functions-program-2-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-3/competitive-functions-program-3-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-4/competitive-functions-program-4-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-5/competitive-functions-program-5-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-6/competitive-functions-program-6-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-7/competitive-functions-program-7-1.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Testing-3/competitive-functions-testing-3-1.c -lm
```

After you have compiled the  program,  type  the  following  
command to run the executable file, that is going to appear  
in the folder:

```
./competitive-testing-bootup-3
```
