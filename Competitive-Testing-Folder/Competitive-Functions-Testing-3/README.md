These  functions  are  created  from  the  original  library  
functions. You can visit the  original  functions  here,  if  
you are on the master branch: [Competitive-Function-Folder-3](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-3)

If you are on the development  branch,  you  can  visit  the  
original functions here: [Competitive-Function-Folder-3](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/development/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-3)

Here is the functions that  tests  the  original  functions:
