These  functions  are  created  from  the  original  library  
functions. You can visit the  original  functions  here,  if  
you are on the master branch: [Competitive-Function-Folder-2](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-2)

If you are on the development  branch,  you  can  visit  the  
original functions here: [Competitive-Function-Folder-2](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/development/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-2)

Here is the functions that  tests  the  original  functions:

```
generate_matrix_array_test       matrix_contains_integer_test

allocate_matrix_integer_test     remove_matrix_integer_test

delete_matrix_integer_test       add_matrix_integer_test

integer_matrix_height_test       compare_matrix_arrays_test

remove_matrix_integers_test      move_matrix_arrays_test

switch_matrix_arrays_test        switch_matrix_integers_test
```
