These  functions  are  created  from  de  original  library  
functions. You  can  visit  the  original  functions  here:
[Competitive-Function-Program-1](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-4)

To compile the program, make sure you have the GCC compiler  
downloaded, and execute the following command in  the  same  
folder as the program.

```
gcc -o competitive-testing-bootup-4 competitive-testing-bootup-4.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-1/competitive-functions-program-1.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-2/competitive-functions-program-2.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-3/competitive-functions-program-3.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-4/competitive-functions-program-4.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-5/competitive-functions-program-5.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-6/competitive-functions-program-6.c \
../../Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Program-7/competitive-functions-program-7.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Testing-4/competitive-functions-testing-4.c -lm
```

After you have compiled the  program,  type  the  following  
command to run the executable file, that is going to appear  
in the folder:

```
./competitive-testing-bootup-4
```
