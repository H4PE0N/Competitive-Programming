This  folder  contains  programs  that  test  the  original
programs from the  'Competitive-Program-Folder'.  When  you
want to create a new  function,  you  will  make  the  test
function here first. Then you will call the  test  function
with  some  different  arguments  and  outputs   from   the
'Competitive-Bootup-Folder'. After that you can create  the
original function in the 'Competitive-Program-Folder'.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

binary_left_shifting_test        binary_or_operation_test

binary_right_shifting_test       binary_xor_operation_test

binary_and_operation_test       binary_not_operation_test
