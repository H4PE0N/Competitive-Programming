These  functions  are  created  from  the  original  library  
functions. You can visit the  original  functions  here,  if  
you are on the master branch: [Competitive-Function-Folder-5](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-5)

If you are on the development  branch,  you  can  visit  the  
original functions here: [Competitive-Function-Folder-5](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/development/Competitive-Program-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Folder-5)

Here is the functions that  tests  the  original  functions:

```
binary_integer_enough_test         calculate_nearest_length_test

reduce_binary_integer_test         convert_integer_binary_test

allocate_binary_bit_test           convert_character_binary_test

allocate_binary_bits_test          calculate_integer_binary_test

calculate_real_length_test         convert_binary_integer_test

convert_binary_character_test      calculate_bit_integer_test
```
