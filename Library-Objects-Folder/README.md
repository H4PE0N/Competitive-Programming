This folder contains all the object  files  to  compile
the executable files. Thanks to the  makefile  in  this
project. The compile-time is much faster  than  if  the
object files didn't exist. That is because  the  object
files already  is  compiled  and  ready  to  become  an
executable file.

The object files is stored exactly as they are  in  the
source folder. That makes it easier to locate and makes
it look more professional stored. It was kind  of  hard
to make it store  the  object  files  in  the  specific
folders as they are now. But it makes it a lot better.

The reason why the object file isn't  in  this  project
when you buy it, is because the object  file  like  the
executable files, is compiled for the processor of your
computer. If I then have compiled all  files  for  you,
your computer wouldn't run any of the  files.  Therefor
you have to compile the  object  files  and  executable
files yourself.
