These folders contains functions  that  test  the  original
functions   from   'Library-Functions-Folder'.   When   you
want to create a new function, you will first make the test
function  here.  Then  you  will  call  the  test  function
with some  different  types  of  inputs  and  outputs  from
'Functions-Testing-Bootup' . After that you can create  the
original function  in  the  'Library-Functions-Folder'.  

By  doing  that  you   are   working   with   "test driven-
development". That means that the risk of creating bugs  in
a function is very low, if you have made  some  requirement
first.

When you are giving a name to the test function,  you  will
take the original functions name and add a "_test" at  they
end  of  the  name.  That  makes  it  easier  to  find  the
corresponding function when you want to access them in your
programs.

Here is a list of all the folders and  what  they  contain:

* Functions-Testing-Folder-1: Integer Arrays
* Functions-Testing-Folder-2: Integer Matrices
* Functions-Testing-Folder-3: Integer Hash-maps
* Functions-Testing-Folder-4: Character Strings
* Functions-Testing-Folder-5: Binary Strings
* Functions-Testing-Folder-6: Statistics
* Functions-Testing-Folder-7: Binary Operations
* Functions-Testing-Folder-8: Integers
* Functions-Testing-Folder-9: String Sentences
