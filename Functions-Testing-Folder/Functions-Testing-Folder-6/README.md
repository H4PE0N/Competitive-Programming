This folder contains functions that test the  corresponding
function in "Library-Functions-Folder". The  test  function
takes in the same arguments as the original  function,  and
an other argument that is a hypothesis of the output of the
original function.

As well as the other folders, this folder follows the "test
driven  development"  rules.  That  means  that  the  test-
function is written before the  actual  function  it  self.
The test-function for this type  of  functions  is  written
here.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

array_integers_sequences_test   array_integer_percent_test

integer_even_median_test        array_integer_frequency_test

integer_array_median_test       update_typical_variables_test

integer_array_average_test      integer_array_typical_test

greater_integer_amount_test     integer_odd_median_test
