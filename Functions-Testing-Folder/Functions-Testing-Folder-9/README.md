This  folder  contains  programs  that  test  the  original
programs  from  the  'Library-Functions-Folder'.  When  you
want to create a new  function,  you  will  make  the  test
function here first. Then you will call the  test  function
with  some  different  arguments  and  outputs   from   the
'Functions-Testing-Bootup'. After that you can  create  the
original function in the 'Library-Functions-Folder'.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

allocate_sentence_character_test  delete_sentence_character_test

sentence_index_string_test        compare_string_sentences_test

generate_string_sentence_test
