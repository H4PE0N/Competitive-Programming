This folder contains functions that test the  corresponding
function in "Library-Functions-Folder". The  test  function
takes in the same arguments as the original  function,  and
an other argument that is a hypothesis of the output of the
original function.

As well as the other folders, this folder follows the "test
driven  development"  rules.  That  means  that  the  test-
function is written before the  actual  function  it  self.
The test-function for this type  of  functions  is  written
here.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

convert_decimal_percent_test        integer_between_integers_test

convert_percent_decimal_test        integer_power_operation_test

integer_range_between_test          check_integer_divisible_test

increase_integer_variable_test      integer_greater_than_test

integer_smaller_than_test           integer_variable_even_test

fraction_variable_denominator_test  compare_integer_variable_test

generate_fraction_variable_test     fraction_variable_numerator_test

integer_variable_odd_test           convert_fraction_percent_test

convert_percent_fraction_test       convert_decimal_fraction_test

convert_fraction_decimal_test       extend_fraction_variable_test

shorten_fraction_variable_test
