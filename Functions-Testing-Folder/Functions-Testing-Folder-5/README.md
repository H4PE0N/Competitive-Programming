This folder contains functions that test the  corresponding
function in "Library-Functions-Folder". The  test  function
takes in the same arguments as the original  function,  and
an other argument that is a hypothesis of the output of the
original function.

As well as the other folders, this folder follows the "test
driven  development"  rules.  That  means  that  the  test-
function is written before the  actual  function  it  self.
The test-function for this type  of  functions  is  written
here.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

binary_integer_enough_test        nearest_binary_length_test

reduce_binary_integer_test        convert_integer_binary_test

allocate_binary_bit_test          convert_character_binary_test

allocate_binary_bits_test         increase_binary_integer_test

actual_binary_length_test         convert_binary_integer_test

convert_binary_character_test     calculate_bit_integer_test

binary_range_between_test         convert_string_binary_test

convert_binary_string_test        convert_array_binary_test

convert_binary_array_test
