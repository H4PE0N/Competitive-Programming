This  folder  contains  programs  that  test  the  original
programs  from  the  'Library-Functions-Folder'.  When  you
want to create a new  function,  you  will  make  the  test
function here first. Then you will call the  test  function
with  some  different  arguments  and  outputs   from   the
'Functions-Testing-Bootup'. After that you can  create  the
original function in the 'Library-Functions-Folder'.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

binary_integer_enough_test         calculate_nearest_length_test

reduce_binary_integer_test         convert_integer_binary_test

allocate_binary_bit_test           convert_character_binary_test

allocate_binary_bits_test          calculate_integer_binary_test

calculate_real_length_test         convert_binary_integer_test

convert_binary_character_test      calculate_bit_integer_test
