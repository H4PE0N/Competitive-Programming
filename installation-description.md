In the programming language C, there is not  a  lot  of
pre-made functions. Therefor have I created  a  library
of programming functions.  This  is  super  useful  for
people who does not program in C. They can program in a
low-level programming language,  but  still  enjoy  the
normal  functions  that  the   high-level   programming
languages has.

To download the library to your computer you can do  it
at two ways. The first  of  way  of  doing  it,  is  to
download the zip folder from GitHub. The other  way  of
doing it, is to download git,  and  clone  the  project
from GitHub. That makes it easy to get new updates when
they comes  out.  Here  is  a  link  to  download  git:
"https://git-scm.com/".

When you have the library on your computer and you have
started using it, you want to compile your program. The
fact that the whole library is  built  of  C  programs,
does that you have to compile with a  C  compiler.  You
can use many different C compilers, but the one that is
guaranteed to work for this  library  is  the  GNU  GCC
compiler.

To download the GNU GCC compiler when your platform  is
mac, you can go to  this  website:  "https://brew.sh/".
You  can  download  the  homebrew  program,  and   then
download the compiler using it. Here is a  great  video
on how to download the  compiler:  "https://www.youtube

If your computer has Windows as its  operating  system,
you can use  the  same  compiler  but  download  it  at
another way. To download the compiler you can go to one
of these  websites:  "https://sourceforge.net/projects/
mingw-w64/".

To make the search motor  work  properly  you  need  to
download a current version of the programming  language
python. This is  because  the  program  that  lets  you
search and show functions is written in python. Here is
a link to the python website:  "https://www.python.org/
downloads/".
