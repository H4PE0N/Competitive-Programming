To download the library to your computer you can do  it
at two ways. The first  of  way  of  doing  it,  is  to
download the zip folder from GitHub. The other  way  of
doing it, is to download Git,  and  clone  the  project
from GitHub. That makes it easy to get new updates when
they comes  out.  Here  is  a  link  to  download  Git:

```

When you have the library on your computer and you have
started using it, you want to compile your program. The
fact that the whole library is  built  of  C  programs,
does that you have to compile with a  C  compiler.  You
can use many different C compilers, but the one that is
guaranteed to work for this  library  is  the  GNU  GCC
compiler.

If your computer has Mac OS ad  its  operating  system,
you  can  download  the  compiler  from  the   Homebrew
program. To download the Homebrew program you can visit
the first website. To then download  the  compiler  you
can follow the video from the second link, to  see  how
you can download it.

If your computer has Windows as its  operating  system,
you can use  the  same  compiler  but  download  it  at
another way. You  could  download  two  compilers,  the
first compiler is the main  one. The  second  one,  you
could download to have as many options as possible.

To make the search motor  work  properly  you  need  to
download a current version of the programming  language
python. This is  because  the  program  that  lets  you
search and show functions is written in python. Here is
a link to the python website:

If your operating system on your computer  is  Windows,
you may  want  to  use  Ubuntu  as  your  terminal.  To
download Ubuntu, you could go to the  Microsoft  Store,
there you download Ubuntu. You may have to download the
programs again, then Ubuntu will prompt  you  with  the
installation commands.

If you are using Git with this library, I recommend you
download the text-editor Atom. It is a text-editor made
for GitHub, so it is easy to do the Git  commands  from
the editor. But the main purpose of using  Atom  is  to
display the project better. Here you can  download  the
text-editor Atom:
