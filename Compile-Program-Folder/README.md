To compile the program, make sure you have the GCC compiler
downloaded, and execute the following command in  the  same
folder as the program.

gcc -o library-compile-program library-compile-program.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-1/library-functions-program-1-1.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-1/library-functions-program-1-2.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-1/library-functions-program-1-3.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-2/library-functions-program-2-1.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-2/library-functions-program-2-2.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-3/library-functions-program-3-1.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-3/library-functions-program-3-2.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-4/library-functions-program-4-1.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-4/library-functions-program-4-2.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-5/library-functions-program-5-1.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-5/library-functions-program-5-2.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-6/library-functions-program-6-1.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-6/library-functions-program-6-2.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-7/library-functions-program-7-1.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-7/library-functions-program-7-2.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-8/library-functions-program-8-1.c \
../Library-Functions-Folder/Library-Functions-Folder-8/library-functions-program-8-2.c -lm

After you have compiled the  program,  type  the  following
command to run the executable file, that is going to appear
in the folder:

./library-compile-program
