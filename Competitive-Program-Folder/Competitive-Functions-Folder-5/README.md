This program contains  functions  that  uses  integer  arrays.  
Every function here, has it's  own  testing  function  in  the  
testing folder. If you are on the master  branch,  go  to  the  
testing program here: [Competitive-Functions-Testing-5](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-5)

If you are on the development branch, then you can  visit  the  
testing program here: [Competitive-Functions-Testing-5](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/development/Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-5)

Here is a list of all the functions that is  in  the  program:
