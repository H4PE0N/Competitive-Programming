Every function here, has  it's  own  testing-function  in  the  
other folder: [Competitive-Functions-Testing-5](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-5)

Here is a list of all the functions that is  in  the  program:

```
binary_integer_enough         calculate_nearest_length

reduce_binary_integer         convert_integer_binary

allocate_binary_bit           convert_character_binary

allocate_binary_bits          calculate_integer_binary

calculate_real_length         convert_binary_integer

convert_binary_character
```
