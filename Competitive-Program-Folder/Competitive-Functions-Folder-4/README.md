These  programs  contains  functions  that  generates   and
perform different types of operations on strings.

If you want to create a new function to this  library,  you
will have to make the test function before. After the  test
function is done, you will have to call the  function  with
some   different   arguments   and   outputs    from    the
'Competitive-Bootup-Folder'. After that you can  write  the
original function and hope that the test calls will  return
a positive output.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

allocate_string_character     switch_string_characters

allocate_string_characters    move_string_characters

generate_empty_string         remove_string_character

calculate_string_length       add_string_character

string_contains_character     compare_strings_together

remove_string_characters
