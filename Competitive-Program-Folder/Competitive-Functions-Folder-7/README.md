This program contains functions that

If you want to create a new function to this  library,  you
will have to make the test function before. After the  test
function is done, you will have to call the  function  with
some   different   arguments   and   outputs    from    the
'Competitive-Bootup-Folder'. After that you can  write  the
original function and hope that the test calls will  return
a positive output.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

binary_left_shifting        binary_or_opperation

binary_right_shifting       binary_xor_opperation

binary_and_opperation       binary_not_opperation
