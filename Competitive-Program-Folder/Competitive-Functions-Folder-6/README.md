has functions that integers things like typical, average and  
common value.  Every  function  here,  has  it's  own  testing  
function in the other folder: [Competitive-Functions-Testing-6](https://github.com/H4PE0N/Competitive-Programming/tree/master/Competitive-Testing-Folder/Competitive-Functions-Testing-6)

Here is a list of all the functions that is  in  the  program:

```
integer_odd_median          update_integer_value

integer_even_median         update_integer_key

integer_array_median        integer_common_value
