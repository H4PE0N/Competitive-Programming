This program contains functions that

If you want to create a new function to this  library,  you
will have to make the test function before. After the  test
function is done, you will have to call the  function  with
some   different   arguments   and   outputs    from    the
'Competitive-Bootup-Folder'. After that you can  write  the
original function and hope that the test calls will  return
a positive output.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

allocate_array_integer      sort_integer_iteration

allocate_array_integers     sort_integer_array

generate_integer_array      add_array_integer

integer_array_length        move_array_integers

array_contains_integer      remove_array_integer

switch_array_integers       delete_array_integer

compare_integer_arrays      remove_array_integers

array_integer_amount
