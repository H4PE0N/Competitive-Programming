This Repository contains a library of competitive programming  
functions that you can use. The purpose of this project is to  
write functions and increase the library.

For every competitive function in this library should it be a  
corresponding test function. The test function should take in  
the arguments of the real function and a hypothesis  of  what  
the function returns, depending on what you put as arguments.

Here is a list of what the folders contains:

* Competitive-Bootup-Folder: Write some tests for the functions
* Competitive-Compile-Program: Write and compile a program
* Competitive-Program-Folder: Folder containing library functions
* Competitive-Testing-Folder: Folder containing test functions
