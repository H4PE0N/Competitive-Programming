This project contains four different folders, they  all
have a role in the Programming-Functions-Library.  This
project is made for GNU makefiles. That means there  is
somewhere a lot  of  source  files,  object  files  and
binary files. Where should they all be stored?

The first folder contains  all  the  executable  files,
that means those file that could run. The are stored in
the Library-Binaries-Folder. There is the makefile also
stored.

The second folder contains images, logotypes  that  you
as a user of the library would have  to  identify  that
you have bought the project.

The third  folder  contains  object  files,  those  are
created from the source files that are located  in  the
other folder. The object files are the reason  why  the
compile-time  is  so  fast.  Thanks  to  them  and  the
makefile, you can compile your program in milliseconds.

The fourth and last folder contains source  files  that
builds up the library. It is  there  all  the  code  is
written and your program  is  stored.  It  is  in  this
folder that the functions is written, so if you want to
use them in another program or just  want  to  see  how
they are made, you will look there.
