This project  contains  a  library  of  useful  programming
functions that you can use. The purpose of this project  is
to write functions and increase the library.

For every function  in  this  library  should  it  exist  a
corresponding  test  function.  The  test  function  should
take in the arguments of the real function and a hypothesis
of what the function returns, depending on what you put  as
arguments.

Here is a list of all the folders and  what  they  contain:

* Compile-Program-Folder:   Write and compile a program
* Functions-Testing-Bootup: Write some tests for the functions
* Functions-Testing-Folder: Folder containing test functions
* Library-Functions-Folder: Folder containing library functions
