In the programming language C, there is not  a  lot  of
pre-made functions. Therefor have I created  a  library
of programming functions.  This  is  super  useful  for
people who does not program in C. They can program in a
low-level programming language,  but  still  enjoy  the
normal  functions  that  the   high-level   programming
languages has.
