This project  contains  a  library  of  useful  programming
functions that you can use. The purpose of this project  is
to write functions and increase the library.

This project is made  for  test  driven  development.  That
means it is a test function  for  every  library  function,
except for the functions that returns a random value  or  a
similar type of function.

Here is a list of all the folders and  what  they  contain:

* Compile-Program-Folder:   Write and compile a program
* Functions-Testing-Bootup: Write some tests for the functions
* Functions-Testing-Folder: Folder containing test functions
* Library-Functions-Folder: Folder containing library functions

When writing in this project, you  will  have  to  consider
following some rules. These rules is just  some  things  to
make the project look nicer and make the reader  understand
what the programs do.

Here is a list of some of the rules that you will  have  to
consider, when working in the project:

* The  lines  of  code  should  only  be  as  long  as  the
  "holy for loop". Two extra spaces are included before:
  for(int index = 0; index < length; index = index + 1)

* The maximum length of a program should only be a  hundred
  lines of code. That includes the include commands  before
  the functions.

* When you deal with  a  two  dimensional  data-type  as  a
  matrix, the measures should be height, and width if  they
  both are named in the function. Else should the naming of
  single measure be index.
