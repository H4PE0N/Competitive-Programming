downloaded, and execute the following command in the same  
folder as the program.

```
gcc -o competitive-testing-bootup-4 competitive-testing-bootup-4.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Program-1/competitive-functions-program-1.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Program-2/competitive-functions-program-2.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Program-3/competitive-functions-program-3.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Program-4/competitive-functions-program-4.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Program-5/competitive-functions-program-5.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Program-6/competitive-functions-program-6.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Program-7/competitive-functions-program-7.c \
../Competitive-Functions-Testing-4/competitive-functions-testing-4.c -lm
```

After you have compiled the program, type the following
