The functions in this folder are all based on the same area
in programming. In this folder you will find functions that
are based on string sentences. Sentences  is  an  array  on
strings, or a two dimensional array on characters. It could
be used when working with a sentence. Or something  like  a
deck of cards, when you want to have an  array  of  strings
(cards).
