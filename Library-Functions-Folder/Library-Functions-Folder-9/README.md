These  programs  contains  functions  that  generates   and
manipulates string sentences. They are string arrays.

If you want to create a new function to this  library,  you
will have to make the test function before. After the  test
function is done, you will have to call the  function  with
some   different   arguments   and   outputs    from    the
'Functions-Testing-Bootup'. After that you  can  write  the
original function and hope that the test calls will  return
a positive output.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

generate_string_sentence    generate_random_sentence

sentence_index_string       compare_string_sentences

string_sentence_stdout      allocate_sentence_character

delete_sentence_character
