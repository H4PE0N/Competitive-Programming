These programs contains functions  that  converts  integers
and characters to binary and on the contrary.

If you want to create a new function to this  library,  you
will have to make the test function before. After the  test
function is done, you will have to call the  function  with
some   different   arguments   and   outputs    from    the
'Functions-Testing-Bootup'. After that you  can  write  the
original function and hope that the test calls will  return
a positive output.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

binary_integer_enough         calculate_nearest_length

reduce_binary_integer         convert_integer_binary

allocate_binary_bit           convert_character_binary

allocate_binary_bits          calculate_integer_binary

calculate_real_length         convert_binary_integer

convert_binary_character      calculate_bit_integer

generate_random_binary        binary_range_between
