The functions in this folder are all based on the same type
area in programming. In this folder you will find functions
that are based on integers. Why the project  has  a  folder
with  only  integers  is  because  they  are  used  in  the
functions that uses integer, like arrays and matrices.  The
folder contains functions that do less common operations on
integers.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

integer_power_operation     convert_percent_decimal

integer_range_between       generate_random_integer

convert_decimal_percent     integer_divisible_by_two

integer_between_integers    increase_integer_variable
