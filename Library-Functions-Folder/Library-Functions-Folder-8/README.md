The functions in this folder are all based on the same area
in programming. In this folder you will find functions that
are based on integers. Why the project has  a  folder  with
only integers is because they are  used  in  the  functions
that uses integer, like arrays  and  matrices.  The  folder
contains  functions  that  do  less  common  operations  on
integers.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

integer_power_operation     convert_percent_decimal

integer_range_between       generate_random_integer

convert_decimal_percent     check_integer_divisible

integer_between_integers    increase_integer_variable

integer_greater_than        integer_smaller_than

integer_variable_even       fraction_variable_denominator

compare_integer_variables   integer_variable_odd

generate_fraction_variable  fraction_variable_stdout

generate_random_fraction    fraction_variable_numerator
