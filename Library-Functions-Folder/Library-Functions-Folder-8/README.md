These programs contains functions that deals with integers.

If you want to create a new function to this  library,  you
will have to make the test function before. After the  test
function is done, you will have to call the  function  with
some   different   arguments   and   outputs    from    the
'Functions-Testing-Bootup'. After that you  can  write  the
original function and hope that the test calls will  return
a positive output.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

integer_power_operation     convert_percent_decimal

integer_range_between       generate_random_integer

convert_decimal_percent
