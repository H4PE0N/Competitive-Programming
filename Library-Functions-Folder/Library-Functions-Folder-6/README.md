These programs contains functions that uses integer  arrays
to calculate different statistics and probability things.

If you want to create a new function to this  library,  you
will have to make the test function before. After the  test
function is done, you will have to call the  function  with
some   different   arguments   and   outputs    from    the
'Functions-Testing-Bootup'. After that you  can  write  the
original function and hope that the test calls will  return
a positive output.

Here is a list of the functions that the programs contains:

greater_integer_amount      array_integer_frequency

integer_even_median         array_integer_percent

integer_array_median        update_typical_variables

integer_array_average       integer_array_typical

integer_odd_median
