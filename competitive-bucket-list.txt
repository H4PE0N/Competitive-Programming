This is a file that you store your ideas about the
project.

1. Look through all the files and change if needed.

  (
    calculate_binary_length in file 5.

    int length = 0; while(decimal > pow(2, length))
    -  { length = (length + 1); } return length;
  )

  File 5 can have two separate functions that calculates
  the length of the characters and calculates the nearest
  length so bitwise operations can be possible.

2. Create a new folder that have hexadecimal conversions.
