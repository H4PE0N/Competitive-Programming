This project is made  for  GNU  makefiles.  That  means
there is  somewhere  source  files,  object  files  and
binary files. Where should they all be stored?

Library-Binaries-Folder - This folder contains contains
all the executable files, the  python  script  and  the
makefile. When you are going to compile, here is  where
you want to be located.

Library-Sources-Folder - This  folder  contains  source
files that builds up the library. It is  here  all  the
code is written and your program is stored. If you want
to use the functions in another program or just want to
see how they are made, you will look in this folder.

Library-Objects-Folder - This  folder  contains  object
files, those  are created from the  source  files.  The
object files are the reason why  the compile-time is so
fast. Thanks to them and the makefile, you can  compile
your program in milliseconds.

Library-Images-Folder - This   folder   contains   some
images/logotypes for  the  project.  It  is  a  way  of
telling people that you use this library.
