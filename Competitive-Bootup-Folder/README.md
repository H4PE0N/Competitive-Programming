This folder contains programs that you can write the tests in.  
It is one folder for every test program, so  if  you  want  to  
test the integer array  functions,  you  will  call  the  test  
functions here.

Here is a list of which test functions the programs have:

* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-1: Integer Arrays
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-2: Matrices
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-3: Integer Hashmaps
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-4: Strings
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-5: Binary Strings
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-6: Statistics, Probability
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-7: Binary Operations
