This folder contains programs that you can write the  tests
in. It is one folder for every test program, so if you want
to test the integer array functions, you will call the test
functions here.

Here is a list of all the folders and  what  they  contain:

* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-1: Integer Arrays
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-2: Matrices
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-3: Integer Hash-maps
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-4: Strings
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-5: Binary Strings
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-6: Statistics, Probability
* Competitive-Testing-Bootup-7: Binary Operations
